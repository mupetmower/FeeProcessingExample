# HarrisERPExercise - Fee Processor

This program was created in Eclipse in a Java 8 environment. Since I used some stream functionality and some lambdas, Java 8 is required to run this program. The stream API and lambda support is not in Java 7 and lower.

# NOTES

In the folder this was downloaded with, There should be folders nameed JavaWindows, JavaMac, JavaLinux. These are where copies of the Java 8 jre reside. I have included these so that it is not necessary for the user to install anything. If you would like to install Java 8 on your machine anyway, please continue to section titled **How to Check Java Version**. Otherwise, continue to the section titled **How to Run with Embedded JRE**.


# How to Run with Embedded JRE

In the main folder you have downloaded called **HarrisERP** there should be files named **RunOnWindows**, **RunOnMac**, and **RunOnLinux**. Simply double-click the file that correcsponds to your operating system, or right-click and choose Open. This should bring up your terminal/console and you should see a command followed by **Welcom to Fee Processor**. You are no running the program and can follow on-screen instructions.

# How to Check Java Version

If you are unsure whether you already have Java installed on your machine, please refer to:

Windows - **java -version**

Mac - open terminal and type **java -version**

Linux - 


If you java version says something like **java version "1.8.0_###"** then you already have Java 8 installed and can continue to **How to Run in Command Line**

# How to Install Java 8
